            <h3>Room and Seat Admin View</h3>
            <p>Project dedicated to enhance the room and seat management system for the Department of Computer
                 Science at UNC's Computer Science Experience Lab (CSXL). We created a feature that displays 
                 rooms and seats in tabular format for admin of the CSXL, while incorporating functionalities 
                 for adding and deleting these seats and rooms as well. In the future, we aim to have a grid 
                 drag and drop UI. </p>
            <p>Using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy, we've established a robust backend layer backed by 
                rigorous unit tests. This layer ensures persistent storage of room and seat data and facilitates
                 efficient querying of data. We implemented a seamless integration between the frontend and 
                 backend by facilitating the exchange of JSON HTTP request bodies. This ensures real-time data 
                 updates and synchronization.</p>
            <p>
                We use agile methodology to organize our collaborative efforts, including sprint planning, 
                stand-ups, and user stories, fostering an iterative and adaptive development process. Extensive 
                use of the git version control system helps us organize the project codebase efficiently, 
                ensuring streamlined collaboration and code management.
            </p>

                RxJS, AngularJS, Python, HTML, CSS</h4>

            <p>Designed a complete and detailed logic puzzle game using the the Model View Controller design. 
                Created a user-friendly UI using JavaFX and CSS for said logic puzzle game, improving user 
                experience with iterative redesign incorporating feedback.</p>

        <div id="Project5" class="tab-content">
            <h3>Hack 110 Project Survival Island</h3>
            <p>Led and directed our team through story writing, code, design, and execution to develop an 
                escape island simulator where the player is given a set of items at the beginning of the game, 
                and are meant to use the items, luck, and logic to escape the seemingly deserted island (Python,
                 HTML, CSS, Flask).</p>
