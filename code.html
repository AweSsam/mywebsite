        <h2 class="title">Room and Seat Admin View</h2> 
        <h3>Project dedicated to enhance the room and seat management system for the Department of Computer
            Science at UNC's Computer Science Experience Lab (CSXL). We created a feature that displays 
            rooms and seats in tabular format for admin of the CSXL, while incorporating functionalities 
            for adding and deleting these seats and rooms as well. In the future, we aim to have a grid 
            drag and drop UI. </h3>
       <h3>Using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy, we've established a robust backend layer backed by 
           rigorous unit tests. This layer ensures persistent storage of room and seat data and facilitates
            efficient querying of data. We implemented a seamless integration between the frontend and 
            backend by facilitating the exchange of JSON HTTP request bodies. This ensures real-time data 
            updates and synchronization.</h3>
       <h3>
           We use agile methodology to organize our collaborative efforts, including sprint planning, 
           stand-ups, and user stories, fostering an iterative and adaptive development process. Extensive 
           use of the git version control system helps us organize the project codebase efficiently, 
           ensuring streamlined collaboration and code management.
